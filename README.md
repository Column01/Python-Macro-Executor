# Python-Macro-Executor

## Install and usage

1. Install dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run script: `python macro_executor.py`

## Adding macros

**NOTE:** Currently only supports pressing a key with a delay. More macro types will be added when I get the chance!

1. Copy the `template.json` to a new file and rename it to something recognizable.
2. Open it and edit the name, key and delay.
3. Restart the program.

## Plans

- More macro types (key sequence with configurable delays, etc.)
- Better GUI and user feedback
